### Measures of Central Tendency  
In any given data set, the values of those data tend to have some points in which they cluster around. Some measures of the degree to which they cluster are described by the mean, median, and mode.

#### Mean  
The mean is the sum of all the individual values divided by the number of values there are. Given a set of data: $[x_1, x_2, x_3, ..., x_n], the mean of the data is defined as follows  

$$\bar{x} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i}$$
