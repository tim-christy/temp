<p>What is web-scraping? It’s taking data from web pages and storing them elsewhere. Via webscraping, you can select data from web pages and store that data into a csv, database, etc.</p>

<p>There is a bit of legal ambiguity around the scraping of websites to be aware of. It seems to me that so long as the data you are scraping is meant for anybody who visits the site, it is likely ok. If you use it after you get past a paywall, that’s probably not legal. Here are a list of articles regarding the legality of it for those who are interested.</p>

<p>We’re going to be scraping data from wikipedia, which allows for web scraping. The site we will be scraping in particular is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population">List of countries and dependencies by population</a>.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="the-packages">The Packages</h3>

<p>We will be using urllib and BeautifulSoup to do out scraping. urllib is part of the Python standard library and should come with Python. If you do not already have BeautifulSoup, you can pip install it via</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>
<span class="n">pip</span> <span class="n">install</span> <span class="n">beautifulsoup4</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>pandas is also imported to help with the storing of the data later.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">urllib.request</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">urlopen</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">bs4</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">BeautifulSoup</span>
<span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">pandas</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">pd</span>  
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once these are imported, we can access the web page using the urllib library. The following lines of code do the following:</p>

<p>1) Store the url in string format into a variable URL</p>

<p>2) Opens the web page at the given url</p>

<p>3) Reads in all the html data and stores this data into a variable called html</p>

<p>4) Closes the connection to the website</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">URL</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population'</span> <span class="c1"># 1)  
</span>
<span class="n">uClient</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">urlopen</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">URL</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1"># 2)  
</span>
<span class="n">html</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">uClient</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">read</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="c1"># 3)  
</span>
<span class="n">uClient</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">close</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="c1"># 4)  
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>If we observe the html variable from above, we see a mess of html data that was taken from the webpage. Below is a preview of the first of many many more lines.</p>

<p><img src="../../../assets/imgs/blogs/2020-02-09/html_mess.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>We can begin to clean this up with BS4. First we create a BeautifulSoup object, which allows us to use BeautifulSoup’s functions to parse through the html data. To make the object we pass our html variable created above and the type of parser we would like to use. We will be using ‘html.parser’ although there are more options than that. You can read about them <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#installing-a-parser">here</a>. Once the soup object is created, your can use the prettify() method to observe a more structured output of the html data.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">soup</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">BeautifulSoup</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">html</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">'html.parser'</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1"># Create soup object  
</span><span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">soup</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">prettify</span><span class="p">())</span>  
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="navigating-the-html-data">Navigating the HTML Data</h3>

<p>BeautifulSoup has methods that make finding data in the html easier. The way this works is by referencing the tags in the html (tags are what’s enclosed in the angel brackets; for example &lt; a &gt; is an anchor tag). You can search through the html by using the find_all method and passing the tag name you are interested in in brackets. One way to identify the tags of interest in a web page is by going to the web page, right clicking, and selecting “Inspect” as shown below (Google Chrome is being used here; may be different on other web browsers).</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><img src="../../../assets/imgs/blogs/2020-02-09/inspects.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>The html data will appear in the upper right corner as shown above. As you hover over the html, the corresonding parts on the web page will be highlighted. You can use this feature to see where the data you are interested in is located. For example, below we want to start at the table. Moving along through the html data shows us where we should start to gather this data.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="grabbing-the-relevant-data-section">Grabbing the relevant data section</h3>

<p>It looks like the ‘td’ tags contain the information we are interested in. We can use the find_all method on our soup object to grab this section by passing ‘td’ as an argument. This will then allow us to begin parsing through the section we are interested in for the data.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">data</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">soup</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">find_all</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">'td'</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1"># Grab the table data section  
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="parsing-to-grab-the-data-of-interest">Parsing to grab the data of interest</h3>

<p>There are probably better ways to do this, but this is how I do it. The data object that has been created can be treated like a list in that it can be iterated through. Typically, I find a way to extract and store the data I am interested in for one row, and then iterate the process with a for loop for the rest of the data. As you can see below, the first item in the object is the rank, the second has the country name, the next has the population data, then the date, followed by the source. The row then repeats in a similar manner when we reach the seventh item in the object (seventh because of zero-indexing).</p>

<p><img src="../../../assets/imgs/blogs/2020-02-09/data_parsing.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>All we have to do is pick out the data of interest and store it for each iteration. You can pick out the data by using the contents attribute. This attribute selects the contents out from the html tags and stores the elements in a list. If the result isn’t what you want, you can continue to parse it down by reusing a combination of indexing and contents. Below we parse out the info we would like for the first row.</p>

<p><img src="../../../assets/imgs/blogs/2020-02-09/contents_ex.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>We just want the country name here and the contents attribute returned way more than we wanted. To get around this we can index the spot in the list that contains the data we want and then use the contents attribute again.</p>

<p><img src="../../../assets/imgs/blogs/2020-02-09/country_content.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The above is how we will grab country names in our loop. Let’s look at how to grab the rest.</p>

<p><img src="../../../assets/imgs/blogs/2020-02-09/pop_dat_contents.png" alt="" /></p>

<h1 id="iterating-the-process">Iterating the process</h1>

<p>Now that we have the genral layout for where our data lies in each row, we can iterate through this process by adjusting the numbers for each row. You may think that because the length of the data object is 1458 and there are 6 items per row, that there is 1458/6 = 243 rows. I did. This turned out to be incorrect because the data object holds data past the rows. I only found this out by attempting to implement the loop for that many rows only to recieve “list index out of range errors”. I found the correct number of rows by manually searching the end of the data object to see where the last country occurs. It happens at index 1441 and so there are actually 1446/6 = 241 rows.</p>

<p>Second thing: the indexing appeared to shift a bit with the contents between two different formats. Ergo, a try-except was implemented to catch both formats. You can see the two different formats based on the way the each of the countries data is appended in the two clauses.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">countries</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[]</span>

<p>As a quick check, I know that there are 241 countries on the web page. I can use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">python len()</code> function to make sure I have them all.</p>
