<p>When I first started in coding in Python, I had no idea what virtual environments were. They were never really necessary for me to learn in my coding projects because I just used Anaconda; which automatically handles virtual environments for you. I like this, in retrospect, but I didn’t like it at the time. It just looked like a mess of file installations on my computer and I didn’t know what anything did other than take up space. It seemed that if I was going to understand it I had to explore it manually. I started simple with a text editor and Ipython from the terminal, but later that grew to include Jupyter Notebooks. In the blog that follows, you’ll find what I learned about virtual environments and a good routine for setting up project environments with Jupyter Notebooks (or a text editor).</p>
