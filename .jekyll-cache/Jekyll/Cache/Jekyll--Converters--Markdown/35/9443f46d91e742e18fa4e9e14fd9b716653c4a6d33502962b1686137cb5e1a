<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>This page discusses a some set theory at an introductory level.</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>
<h2 id="sets">Sets</h2>
<p><b>Sets</b> are a unique collection of items. These items can be anything: numbers, apples, oranges, types of toothpaste, cars, galaxies, whatever. The individual items that compose a set are called <br />elements&lt;/br&gt;. Sets are denoted with curly braces and the elements are listed inside separated by a comma. Below are some examples:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\begin{aligned}
  S_1 &= \{1, 2, 3, 4\} \\[0.5em]
  S_2 &= \{\text{rain, cats, dogs}\}\\[0.5em]
  S_3 &= \{\text{green, red, blue, orange, purple}\}
\end{aligned} %]]></script>

<p>In set notation when an element <script type="math/tex">x</script> belongs to a set <script type="math/tex">A</script> it is denoted</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">x \in A</script>

<p>If an element does not belong to a set <script type="math/tex">A</script> it is denoted</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">x \not \in A</script>

<p>The order and repetition does not matter when it comes to a set.
That is to say</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\{\text{a, a, a, b, c}\} = \{\text{a, b, c}\} = \{\text{c, b, a}\} = \{\text{b, c, a}\}</script>

<p>The equation immediately above shows that all 4 sets are all equal. Repetition does not matter. Order does not matter. All that matters is that you have the unique elements that belong to the set.</p>

<p>Although sets can contain anything, when talking about discrete and continuous sets, it is helpful to think of set elements as numbers.</p>

<p>A discrete set contains discrete elements. These elements are easy to understand because they are well-defined points. This is perhaps best illustrated by comparing them to the elements of a continuous set. Take the set of whole numbers 1 through 5. This discrete set is <script type="math/tex">S_d = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}</script>. That is 5 elements in total. However, the continuous set over this range, <script type="math/tex">S_c = \{x\  | \ 1 \leq x \leq 5\}</script>, would have an infinite number of elements between 1 and 5. This is because this continuous set can take on ANY value between 1 and 5, including decimals (i.e., 1.000000001‚Ä¶, 1.0000000100001‚Ä¶, 2.324174893261‚Ä¶, 4.9999999999‚Ä¶) There are an infinite selection. So the elements of <script type="math/tex">S_d</script> are discrete, while the elements of <script type="math/tex">S_c</script> are continuous. The graph below shows a representation of these sets on the number line.<br />
<img src="sets_imgs/discrete_continuous_fig.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>In starting examples above, <script type="math/tex">S_1</script>, <script type="math/tex">S_2</script>, and <script type="math/tex">S_3</script> were discrete sets.<br />
The mathematical notation for the continuous set <script type="math/tex">S_c = \{x\ | \ 1 \leq x \leq 5\}</script> can be read aloud as ‚Äú<script type="math/tex">S_c</script> equals the set of all x, such that x is any value greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 5.‚Äù The | marker in the notation can be read as ‚Äúsuch that‚Äù. Sometimes it is written as a colon (:) instead, but it means the same thing (i.e., <script type="math/tex">\{x\ | \ 1 \leq x \leq 5\} = \{x\ : \ 1 \leq x \leq 5\}</script>).</p>

<p>Another example of a continuous set is the set of real numbers, denoted</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\mathbb{R} = \{x\ |\ -\infty < x < \infty\} %]]></script>

<p>and read in the same manner as before (i.e., ‚Äúthe set of all x such that x is any value in between negative infinity and positive infinity‚Äù). It is the set of all the values on the number line. There is more about set notation in the last section of this blog.</p>

<h3 id="subsets-disjoint-sets-null-set-and-universal-set">Subsets, Disjoint Sets, Null Set, and Universal Set</h3>
<p>Set <script type="math/tex">A</script> is a <script type="math/tex">\textbf{subset}</script> of set <script type="math/tex">B</script> if <script type="math/tex">A</script> only contains elements that are found in <script type="math/tex">B</script>. <script type="math/tex">A</script> does not have to have all of the elements of <script type="math/tex">B</script>, it may only contain a few, but all of its elements are in <script type="math/tex">B</script> nonetheless. In mathematical notation, to indicate that <script type="math/tex">A</script> is a subset of <script type="math/tex">B</script> we write</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">A \subseteq B</script>

<p>Note that it is similar to a less than or equal to sign with the curved edge always pointing toward the subset.</p>

<p>A subset can contain all the elements of its parent set. That is, set <script type="math/tex">A</script> can be equal to set <script type="math/tex">B</script> and still <script type="math/tex">A</script> is a subset of <script type="math/tex">B</script>. Conversely <script type="math/tex">B</script> is also a subset of <script type="math/tex">A</script>. This means that every set is a subset of itself. The above notation includes this definition.</p>

<p>This is to be contrasted with a <script type="math/tex">\textbf{proper subset}</script> which is a subset of a parent set that contains fewer elements than the parent set. If <script type="math/tex">A</script> is a proper subset of <script type="math/tex">B</script> then we write</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">A \subset B</script>

<p>Again, this notation means that <script type="math/tex">A</script> contains only elements of <script type="math/tex">B</script> but not all of the elements of <script type="math/tex">B</script>. Anytime that <script type="math/tex">A</script> is a proper subset of <script type="math/tex">B</script> it is also a subset of <script type="math/tex">B</script>. A parallel can be drawn with less than or equal to signs. If number <script type="math/tex">a</script> is less than number <script type="math/tex">b</script> then number <script type="math/tex">a</script> is also less than or equal to number <script type="math/tex">b</script>. Similarly if set <script type="math/tex">A</script> is a proper subset of set <script type="math/tex">B</script>, then set <script type="math/tex">A</script> is also a subset of set <script type="math/tex">B</script>.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display"></script>

<p><script type="math/tex">\textbf{Examples}</script></p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>To illustrate that last point, if <script type="math/tex">A</script> = {12, 15} and <script type="math/tex">B</script> = {12, 13, 14, 15, 16} then<br />
 <script type="math/tex">A \subset B</script> and <script type="math/tex">A \subseteq B</script>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If <script type="math/tex">A = \{1, 2, 3\}</script> and <script type="math/tex">B = \{1, 2, 3\}</script> then <script type="math/tex">A \subseteq B</script> and <script type="math/tex">B \subseteq A</script></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If <script type="math/tex">A = \{\text{Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, Michael Collins}\}</script> and <br />
<script type="math/tex">B = \{\text{All Astronauts}\}</script> then
<script type="math/tex">A \subset B</script> (and <script type="math/tex">A \subseteq B</script> but that point has been driven and so from here on will omit that bit of pedanticism).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If <script type="math/tex">A = \{\text{USA, Argentina, Liberia, Japan, France}\}</script> and <script type="math/tex">B = \{\text{all countries}\}</script> then <script type="math/tex">A \subset B</script></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If <script type="math/tex">A = \{\text{USA, Argentina, Liberia, an apple, Japan, France}</script> and <script type="math/tex">B =\{\text{all countries}</script> then <script type="math/tex">A</script> is NOT a subset of <script type="math/tex">B</script> because of the apple found in set <script type="math/tex">A</script> and not in set <script type="math/tex">B</script>. This is denoted by <script type="math/tex">A \not \subset B</script> or <script type="math/tex">A \not \subseteq B</script></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display"></script>

<p><script type="math/tex">\textbf{Superset}</script><br />
When <script type="math/tex">A</script> is a subset of <script type="math/tex">B</script>, we can call <script type="math/tex">B</script> a superset of <script type="math/tex">A</script>. This can be written as</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">B \supseteq A</script>

<p>or, if <script type="math/tex">B</script> is a proper superset of <script type="math/tex">A</script></p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">B \supset A</script>

<p>where <script type="math/tex">\superseteq</script> and <script type="math/tex">superset</script> are the superset and proper superset signs respectively.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display"></script>

<p><script type="math/tex">\textbf{Disjoint Sets}</script><br />
Two sets are said to be <script type="math/tex">\textbf{disjoint}</script> if they do not share any elements. If set<br />
<script type="math/tex">A = \{\text{a, b, c}\}</script> and set <script type="math/tex">B = \{\text{x, y, z}\}</script> then they share no common elements and are disjoint.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display"></script>

<p><script type="math/tex">\textbf{Null Set}</script><br />
The <script type="math/tex">\textbf{null set}</script> is a set that has no elements. It is represented with this symbol: <script type="math/tex">\emptyset</script></p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\emptyset = \{\}</script>

<p>The null set is a subset of every set; including itself.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display"></script>

<p><script type="math/tex">\textbf{Universal Set}</script><br />
The universal set contains all elements of interest and is denoted by <script type="math/tex">\Omega</script>. The definition of the universal set will vary depending on the elements of interest. Some demonstrations of universal sets can be the set of all astronauts or the set of all countries as shown in the examples above. Another example could be the set of all outcomes for rolling a pair of dice.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display"></script>

<h2 id="cardinality">Cardinality$$</h2>
<p>Cardinality refers to the number of elements in a set. For example, if the set A is <script type="math/tex">\\[1em]</script></p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">A = \{1, 2 ,3 ,4 ,5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\} \\[1em]</script>

<p>The cardinality of A is denoted
<script type="math/tex">|A|</script>
and here
<script type="math/tex">|A| = 10</script>.</p>

<p>More examples:  <script type="math/tex">\\[1em]</script>
<script type="math/tex">\text{If }B = \{\mathrm{a}, \mathrm{b}, \mathrm{c}\} \text{ then } |B| = 3 \\[0.5em]</script><br />
<script type="math/tex">\text{If } C = \{\mathrm{Nevada}, \mathrm{New York}, \mathrm{California}, \mathrm{Oregon}, \mathrm{Hawaii}\} \text{ then } |C| = 5</script></p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display"></script>

<h2 id="sets-and-probability">Sets and Probability</h2>
<p>One way to describe the probability of an event happening is to say it is the number of ways that the event can happen divided by the number of ways all things can happen. For example, suppose a family is going to have two new children. What is the probability both babies will be born girls? How about the probability of having a boy and a girl? To observe the probabilities in this manner we can look at the cardinality of the sets that contain the outcomes of interest and the set that contains all possible outcomes (the universal set <script type="math/tex">\Omega</script>). The universal set is<script type="math/tex">\\[.2em]</script></p>

<p><script type="math/tex">\hspace{5.2cm}\Omega = \{</script> bb, bg, gb, gg<script type="math/tex">\} \\[0.1em]</script><br />
with cardinality |<script type="math/tex">\Omega</script>| <script type="math/tex">= 4</script>. Above b represents a boy, g represents a girl, and the order in which they are born is represented by the order in which they appear (i.e., gb means the first child is a girl, the second a boy). If the event we are interested in is that both babies are born girls, we can represent that event with the set <script type="math/tex">A</script></p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">A = \{gg\}</script>

<p>If we take the cardinality of <script type="math/tex">A</script> divided by the cardinality of <script type="math/tex">\Omega</script>, we get the probability of the event that both babies will be girls, denoted <script type="math/tex">P(A)</script></p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">P(A) = \frac{|A|}{|\Omega|} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25</script>

<p>Ergo, there is a 25% probability of this happening.</p>

<p>For the probability of having a boy and a girl, the events we are interested in are listed in the set below</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">B = \{bg, gb\}</script>

<p>The universal set is the same as it was before and so the probability of this happening becomes</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">P(B) = \frac{|B|}{|\Omega|} = \frac{2}{4} = 0.5</script>

<p>Sets and cardinality can be a helpful way of thinking in regards to solving some basic probability problems. In particular, this only really works if the probabilities of each outcome are equal. Here we assumed it was so, but often they are not this simple. If the mother had say a genetic mutation that made them 75% more likely to have a boy, these probabilities would be different. More on probability will be discussed in a future post.</p>

<h2 id="set-operations">Set Operations</h2>

<h3 id="union">Union</h3>
<p>A union of two sets is the unique collection of all the elements between the two sets. The union between sets <script type="math/tex">A</script> and <script type="math/tex">B</script> is represented like so</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">A \cup B</script>

<p>where <script type="math/tex">\cup</script> is the union operator.<br />
<script type="math/tex">\\[2em]</script>
<script type="math/tex">\textbf{Examples}</script><br />
<script type="math/tex">\textbf{1)}</script> If <script type="math/tex">A = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\} \text{ and } B = \{4, 5, 6, 7, 8\}</script> then</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">A \cup B = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\}</script>

<p>Notice how both sets <script type="math/tex">A</script> and <script type="math/tex">B</script> contain the numbers 4, 5, and 6 but that their union only has one 4, 5, and 6. This is again because sets only contain unique elements.<script type="math/tex">\\[3em]</script></p>

<p><script type="math/tex">\textbf{2)}</script> If <script type="math/tex">A = \{\text{orange, green, red, blue}\} \text{ and } B = \{\text{purple, yellow}\}</script> then</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">A \cup B = \{\text{orange, green, red, blue, purple, yellow}\}</script>

<p>If the sets have no items in common, they are called <script type="math/tex">\textbf{disjoint}</script> sets.<br />
In example 2, <script type="math/tex">A</script> and <script type="math/tex">B</script> are disjoint sets.  <script type="math/tex">\\[3em]</script></p>

<p><script type="math/tex">\textbf{3)}</script> The union operator can also be used over many sets.<br />
 If <script type="math/tex">A = \{\text{1, 2, 3, 4}\} \text{ and } B = \{\text{3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}\} \text{ and } C = \{\text{9, 10, 11}\} \text{ and } D = \{\text{11, 12, 13, 14, 15}\}</script> then</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">A \cup B \cup C \cup D = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15\}</script>

<p>To generalize</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\bigcup\limits_{i=1}^{n}A_i = A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \cdots \cup A_n \\[3em]</script>

<p><script type="math/tex">\textbf{Venn Diagrams}</script><br />
Venn Diagrams are helpful in visualizing set operations. Each circle represents a set and their overlap represents the elements each set has in common. If the circles do not overlap, then the sets are disjoint. This is shown in the figure below<br />
<script type="math/tex">\\[2em]</script></p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\textbf{Venn Diagrams   \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \      }</script>

<p><img src="sets_imgs/Venn1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The union of sets <script type="math/tex">A</script> and <script type="math/tex">B</script> can be represented in a Venn Diagram like so</p>

<p><img src="sets_imgs/union.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>where the red shading represents the elements of the set that are included via the union of sets <script type="math/tex">A</script> and <script type="math/tex">B</script>.</p>

<h3 id="intersection">Intersection</h3>
<p>The intersection of two sets picks out only the elements that are contained in both sets. The intersection of sets <script type="math/tex">A</script> and <script type="math/tex">B</script> is a set that contains only elements that are common to both <script type="math/tex">A</script> and <script type="math/tex">B</script>. Intersection between sets A and B are represented like so</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">A \cap B</script>

<p>where <script type="math/tex">\cap</script> is the intersection operator.<script type="math/tex">\\[3em]</script></p>

<p><script type="math/tex">\textbf{1)}</script> If <script type="math/tex">A = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\} \text{ and } B = \{4, 5, 6, 7, 8\} \text{ then }</script></p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">A\cap B = \{4, 5\}</script>

<p><script type="math/tex">\textbf{2)}</script> If <script type="math/tex">A = \{1, 2, 3, 4\} \text{ and } B = \{5, 6, 7, 8\} \text{ then }</script></p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">A \cap B = \{\} = \emptyset</script>

<p>where <script type="math/tex">\emptyset</script> represents the empty set. The empty set is exactly what it sounds like - a set with no elements in it.</p>

<p><script type="math/tex">\textbf{3)}</script> The intersection operator can also be used over many sets.<br />
 If <script type="math/tex">A = \{\text{1, 2, 3, 4}\} \text{ and } B = \{\text{4, 6, 8, 9}\} \text{ and } C = \{\text{13, 101, 4, 2 }\} \text{ and } D = \{\text{100, 90, 91, 4}\}</script> then</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">A \cap B \cap C \cap D = \{4\}</script>

<p>To generalize</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\bigcap\limits_{i=1}^{n}A_i = A_1 \cap A_2 \cap \cdots \cap A_n</script>

<p>The Venn Diagram representing the intersection of set <script type="math/tex">A</script> and <script type="math/tex">B</script> is shown below.</p>

<p><img src="sets_imgs/intersection.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Note that for disjoint sets the circles do not overlap and there is no intersection. The intersection of two or more disjoint sets is always the empty set <script type="math/tex">\emptyset</script>.</p>

<h3 id="complement">Complement</h3>
<p>The complement of a set <script type="math/tex">A</script> is every element in the universal set that is not in <script type="math/tex">A</script>. Suppose set <script type="math/tex">A = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}</script> and set <script type="math/tex">B = \{4, 5, 6, 7, 8\}</script> and the universal set is the set of all integers, <script type="math/tex">\Omega = \mathbb{Z}</script> <script type="math/tex">\left(\mathbb{Z} = \bigcup_{-\infty}^{\infty}\{i\} = \{ -\infty , ..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., \infty \}\right)</script>. Then the complement of <script type="math/tex">A</script>, denoted <script type="math/tex">A^c</script> is the set of all integers without 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Likewise, the complement of <script type="math/tex">B</script>, denoted <script type="math/tex">B^c</script> is the set of all integers without 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.</p>

<p><img src="sets_imgs/a_complement.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="sets_imgs/b_complement.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Note that the universal set has not been illustrated in a figure until now. Although it has been omitted in the other figures, the universal set is always present.</p>

<p>Also, the complement of the universal set is the null set and the complement of the null set is the universal set.</p>

<h3 id="difference">Difference</h3>
<p>The difference between sets <script type="math/tex">A</script> and <script type="math/tex">B</script> are all the elements in <script type="math/tex">A</script> that are not in <script type="math/tex">B</script>. Or, perhaps better said, it is the set <script type="math/tex">A</script> with any and all elements of set <script type="math/tex">B</script> taken out of it. The difference between a set <script type="math/tex">A</script> and set <script type="math/tex">B</script> is represented by</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">A-B</script>

<p>As a simple example, if <script type="math/tex">A = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}</script> and <script type="math/tex">B = \{4, 5, 6, 7, 8\}</script>, then</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">A-B = \{1, 2, 3\}</script>

<p><img src="sets_imgs/a_minus_b.png" alt="" />
<img src="sets_imgs/b_minus_a.png" alt="" /></p>

<h3 id="symmetric-difference">Symmetric Difference</h3>
<p>The <script type="math/tex">\textbf{symmetric difference}</script> between two sets <script type="math/tex">A</script> and <script type="math/tex">B</script> is the set that contains all the elements of <script type="math/tex">A</script> and <script type="math/tex">B</script> but NOT BOTH <script type="math/tex">A</script> and <script type="math/tex">B</script>. The symmetric difference between <script type="math/tex">A</script> and <script type="math/tex">B</script> is denoted</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">A \Delta B</script>

<p>For example, if <script type="math/tex">A = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}</script> and <script type="math/tex">B = \{4, 5, 6, 7, 8\}</script> (again), then the symmetric difference between <script type="math/tex">A</script> and <script type="math/tex">B</script> is</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">A \Delta B = \{1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8\}</script>

<p>Put another way, it is all the elements of <script type="math/tex">A</script> and <script type="math/tex">B</script> that they do not share in common.</p>

<p><img src="sets_imgs/a_delta_b.png" alt="" /></p>

<h3 id="cartesian-product">Cartesian Product</h3>
<p>The <script type="math/tex">\textbf{\text{Cartesian Product}}</script> between two sets is a set comprised of tuples containing pairs of elements between the two sets. That is to say the first element of the first set paired with all the elements of the second, the second element of the first set paired with all the elements of the second, the third element of the firs set‚Ä¶ and so on until the last element of the first set. The Cartesian Product is denoted with a <script type="math/tex">\times</script> sign and a tuple, which is a way to group multiple parts as a single element of a set is denoted with parentheses. Examples below.</p>

<p><script type="math/tex">\textbf{Examples}</script><br />
<script type="math/tex">\textbf{1)}</script> Suppose <script type="math/tex">A = \{a, b, c\}</script> and <script type="math/tex">B = \{1, 2, 3\}</script>. Then the Cartesian Product of <script type="math/tex">A</script> and <script type="math/tex">B</script> is</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">A \times B = \{(a,1), (b, 2), (c, 3)\}</script>

<p>The sets can be of different sizes as the next example shows<br />
<script type="math/tex">\textbf{2)}</script> Suppose <script type="math/tex">A = \{a, b, c, d, e \}</script> and <script type="math/tex">B = \{1, 2\}</script>. Then the Cartesian Product of these two sets is</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">A \times B = \{(a, 1), (a, 2), (b, 1), (b,2), (c,1), (c,2), (d,1), (d, 2), (e, 1), (e,2)\}</script>

<p>The Cartesian Product can be performed on many sets at once, adding to the number of elements in each tuple as the next example shows.<br />
<script type="math/tex">\textbf{3)}</script> Let <script type="math/tex">A = \{a, b,\}, B = \{1, 2, 3\}, \text{ and } C = \{\alpha\}</script>. Then <script type="math/tex">A \times B \times C</script> is</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">A \times B \times C = \{(a, 1, \alpha), (a, 2, \alpha), (a, 3, \alpha), (b, 1, \alpha), (b, 2, \alpha), (b, 3, \alpha)\}</script>

<p>Generally,</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><script type="math/tex">A_1 \times A_2 \times ... \times A_n</script> = {(a_1, a_2, ‚Ä¶, a_n)</td>
      <td>a_1 \in A_1, a_2 \in A_2, ‚Ä¶, a_n \in A_n}$$</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>where <script type="math/tex">\in</script> denotes membership to a set. <script type="math/tex">x \in A</script> means that x is an element in set <script type="math/tex">A</script>. More about this is explained in the next section.</p>

<p>Recall that the set of real numbers is</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
\mathbb{R} = \{ x | - \infty < x < \infty \} %]]></script>

<p>What then, is the Cartesian Product of <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}</script>? It is every possible point in a plane and the set is denoted <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{R}^2</script>. If we think of the first item in the tuple as the x-coordinate and the second item in the tuple as the y-coordinate, every point in a plane is in the set <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{R}^2</script>. The points (1, 1), (1.000001, 2.20008), (10.23432, 9.4322), (1000000, 2000000), all of them, every single possible point in a plane, is in this set. It is expressed</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\mathbb{R}^2 = \{(x, y) | x \in \mathbb{R}, y \in \mathbb{R}\}</script>

<p>How about <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R} = \mathbb{R}^3</script>? Well that is the same thing as <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{R}^2 \times \mathbb{R}</script>. This gives the set of every possible three-element tuple, which can be used in describing every point in three dimensional space.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\mathbb{R}^3 = \{(x, y, z) | x \in \mathbb{R}, y \in \mathbb{R}, z \in \mathbb{R}\}</script>

<p>And so on into higher dimensions‚Ä¶</p>

<h2 id="set-notation">Set Notation</h2>
<p>The following contains some basic set-builder notation which can be very helpful in communicating sets. Everything here I learned from a <a href="https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:UCSanDiegoX+DSE210x+3T2019/course/">edX</a> [1] course called ‚ÄúProbability and Statistics in Data Science using Python‚Äù and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set-builder_notation">the wikipedia article on set-builder notation</a> [2].</p>

<p>To signify that an element belongs to a set, the notation <script type="math/tex">\in</script> is used. If we have a set <script type="math/tex">A = \{a, b, c, d, e\}</script> then <script type="math/tex">a \in A</script>,  <script type="math/tex">b \in A</script>, and so on. If an element does not belong to a set it is denoted with <script type="math/tex">\not\in</script>. Many of these symbols are negated by just drawing a dash through them. In particular, subsets and supersets are too (<script type="math/tex">\not\subset, \not\subseteq, \not\supset, \not\supseteq</script>).</p>

<p>Below are the set operations, defined <a href="sets#textbfset-operations">above</a>, in set notation. New notation will appear and be defined as they do. The translation of each set will also be written below to help the reader build some basic intuition for reading set notation.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display"></script>

<h4 id="union-in-set-notation">Union in Set Notation</h4>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">A \cup B = \{ x | x \in  A \lor x \in B\}</script>

<p>‚ÄúThe set of all elements x such that x is a member of set <script type="math/tex">A</script> or x is a member of set <script type="math/tex">B</script>.‚Äù</p>

<p>The <script type="math/tex">\lor</script> is the ‚Äúlogical or‚Äù operator that means if either expression on the left or right of it is true (or both) then x is a member of this set.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display"></script>

<h4 id="intersection-in-set-notation">Intersection in Set Notation</h4>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">A \cap B = \{x | x \in A \land x \in B\}</script>

<p>‚ÄúThe set of all elements x such that x is in set A and x is in set B‚Äù</p>

<p>where <script type="math/tex">\land</script> is the ‚Äúlogical and‚Äù operator that means both the expression on the left AND the expression on the right must be true for x to be a member in this set.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display"></script>

<h4 id="complement-in-set-notation">Complement in Set Notation</h4>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">A^c = \{x | x \not\in A \}</script>

<p>‚ÄúThe set of all elements x such that x is not in A‚Äù</p>

<p>Or if <script type="math/tex">C = \Omega - A</script>,</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">A^c = \{x | x \in C\}</script>

<p>‚ÄúThe set of all elements x such that x is in C‚Äù</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display"></script>

<h4 id="difference-in-set-notation">Difference in Set Notation</h4>
<p><script type="math/tex">A - B = \{x | x \in A \land x \not\in B\}</script></p>

<p>‚ÄúThe set of all elements x such that x is in set <script type="math/tex">A</script> and x is not in set <script type="math/tex">B</script>‚Äù</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display"></script>

<h4 id="symmetric-difference-in-set-notation">Symmetric Difference in Set Notation</h4>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">A \Delta B = \{ x | (x \in A \land x \not\in B ) \lor (x \not\in A \land x \in B) \}</script>

<p>‚ÄúThe set of all elements x such that (x is in A AND not in B) OR (x is not in AND x is in B)‚Äù</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display"></script>

<h4 id="cartesian-product-in-set-notation">Cartesian Product in Set Notation</h4>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">A \times B = \{(x, y) | x \in A, y \in B\}</script>

<p>‚ÄúThe set of all tuples (x,y) where x is in set <script type="math/tex">A</script> and y is in set <script type="math/tex">B</script>‚Äù</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display"></script>

<p>What follows here are some more basic set notation that was not covered before. They will be explained as they are introduced.</p>

<h4 id="integer-intervals">Integer Intervals</h4>
<p>An integer interval is a set of consecutive integers leading up to <script type="math/tex">n</script> starting from 1. It is denoted like so</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">[n] = \{x \in \mathbb{Z} | 1 \leq x \leq n \} = \{1, 2, 3, ..., n\}</script>

<p>‚ÄúThe set of all elements x in \mathbb{Z} such that x is in between 1 and n‚Äù</p>

<h4 id="continuous-intervals">Continuous Intervals</h4>
<p>Whereas the above intervals are discrete, these are continuous. The thing to pay attention to here is whether there is a bracket, which includes the end points of an interval, or a parentheses, which omits the endpoints.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">[a, b] = \{x | a \leq x \leq b\}</script>

<p>‚ÄúThe set of all elements x such that x is greater than or equal to a and less than or equal to b‚Äù<br />
Notice both a and b are included in this set.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
(a, b) = \{x | a < x < b \} %]]></script>

<p>‚ÄúThe set of all elements x such that x is greater than a but less than b‚Äù<br />
Notice that the end points a and b are not included in this set.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
[a, b) = \{x | a \leq x < b \} %]]></script>

<p>‚ÄúThe set of all elements x such that x is greater than or equal to a but less than b‚Äù<br />
a is included in this set, but b is not.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">% <![CDATA[
(a, b] = \{x | a < x \leq b\} %]]></script>

<p>‚ÄúThe set of all elements x such that x is greater than a but less than or equal to b‚Äù<br />
b is included in this set but a is not.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display"></script>

<h4 id="sets-of-multiples">Sets of Multiples</h4>
<p>The notation <script type="math/tex">m|i</script> can be used to denote integer multiples. This notation is probably the reason why ‚Äú:‚Äù can be used to mean ‚Äúsuch that‚Äù as well as ‚Äú|‚Äù. Here is the set that can explain multiples</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">{}_m[n] = \{i \in [n] : m|i \}</script>

<p>‚ÄúThe set of all elements i in the integer interval n such that each element i is divisible by m‚Äù <br />
Recall that <script type="math/tex">m|i</script> is an integer, so anything that qualifies to be in the set is evenly divisible by <script type="math/tex">m</script>. Also recall from above that [n] is the set that contains all the integers from 1 to n. Below are some examples.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display"></script>

<p><script type="math/tex">\textbf{Examples}</script><br />
<script type="math/tex">\textbf{1)} \ {}_5[20] = \{x \in [20] : 5|x \} = \{5, 10, 15, 20\}</script></p>

<p>The middle part of that equation is read ‚Äúthe set x in the integer interval up to 20 such that x is divisible by 5‚Äù. It can be helpful to remember that the subscript in front is the divisor.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\textbf{2)} \ {}_2[20] = \{2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20\}</script>

<p>Integers in general can be used in lieu of the integer interval to capture subsets of all integers. For instance</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\textbf{3)} \ {}_2\mathbb{Z} = \{x \in \mathbb{Z} : 2|x \} = \mathbb{E}</script>

<p>where <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{E}</script> is the set of all even integers.
<!-- May want to add _m[n] = \{i \in [n] : m|i \} --></p>
