<p>The basic idea is that you can find the probabilities by simulating outcomes with a computer. For example, if you are rolling 5 dice, what is the probability that those dice will sum to 25? If you are good at probability, you may be able to quickly find all the ways you can get a sum of 25 out of all the possible outcomes. If you’re not, or even if you are, letting a computer do the work for you is probably easier. This blog discusses the basic idea of simulated outcomes and gives several examples in Python.</p>
