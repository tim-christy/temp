<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>When working on a project in Python, you‚Äôll likely be importing packages to expand the functionality of your code (stuff like numpy, pandas, etc). A problem arises with this in that these packages are being updated all the time and these updates can mess up the functionality of your code later on. Virtual environments are a way to contain the exact versions of the packages you use for a specific project. This way, if you come back to the project many updates later, the project will still work exactly as it did when you first coded it.  <br />
<br />
The basic process is as follows: \</p>
<ul>
  <li>Start a project\</li>
  <li>Create a virtual environment for the project\</li>
  <li>pip install packages you need for the project into the virtual environment\</li>
  <li>After the project is finished use the virtual environment to output a text document that lists every package and version number you used (usually called ‚Äúrequirements.txt‚Äù or ‚Äúenvironment.yml‚Äù)\</li>
  <li>Upload to github or wherever\</li>
  <li>With the project complete and uploaded to github with the requirements, you can delete it off your computer\</li>
  <li>In the future, if you want to run this project again, you can pip install out of the requirements text and open the project as you had it when you first coded it
<br /></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="virtual-environments">Virtual Environments</h3>
<p>To start working with virtual environments, first it must be created (details in the sections that follow). After the virtual environment is created, it has to be activated in order to use it. When a virtual environment is activated for a project, it is like starting with a clean slate; nothing outside of a typical download of Python is installed. With the environment activated, all package installations from thereon will be installed in the environment. The virtual environment can be deactivated whenever the project is not being worked on and multiple virtual environments can be created for multiple projects, however, only one virtual environment should be activated at a time. When a project is complete, a text file can be made that specify the exact versions of every package used. Once this file is made, the project can be reopened exactly the way it was as when it was first completed.</p>

<p>Virtual environments are isolated from each other. In order to use one it must be activated before going into a project. Fail to do so and the project will use the packages that are pointed to by default; which can lead to problems, but they can be fixed again by activating the virtual environment and installing the correct packages.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>The basic process is as follows: I want to start a project, so I create a new project folder on my Desktop and cd into it. Then I activate a virtual environment inside this folder. Once the virtual environment is activated, I can start coding my project, using pip installs as needed. With the environment activated, all pip installs will be stored within the environment. If I need to come back to the project later, I can deactivate the virtual environment and reactivate it again later when I want to work on my project again. When I am finished with my project, I create a requirements text that lists all the packages I used in my project. This requirements text will show up in my project folder. Then I push everything up to github (my code and this text file), deactivate the virtual environment and delete it from my computer. I typically delete the whole project once it‚Äôs finished and on github.</p>

<p><br />
If you found that above description to be lacking in specifics, that is because there are many different virtual environment managers that each have their own specific code to start, activate, deactivate a virtual environment, and different pip installs as well. Some of these are listed below.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="venv-virtualenv-pipenv">venv, virtualenv, pipenv</h3>

<p>Initially, I began managing virtual environments with virtualenv. As far as I know, venv and virtualenv do the same thing in that you can use them to create virtual environments for projects. These are fine and they work, but it seems that pipenv is the better way to go.
The reason is due to how you share the packages you used with others. When you are finished with a project, you will want to output a text document that contains a list of all the packages you used for the project and their version numbers. venv and virtualenv do this but they do so in a manner that is harder to understand because the list contains everything used, including development packages, like flake8, and it does not distinguish between low-level and high-level dependencies so it is hard to see what you used for your project without going into it. With pipenv this list is called a pipfile, and it contains the packages a project used in an easier-to-read manner. You can still output a requirements.txt file as well with pipenv.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="pyenv">pyenv</h3>
<p>Putting virtual environments aside for a moment, you may want to install pyenv. pyenv is a way to control which version of python is being used for a project. You can also use pyenv-virtualenv to control virtual environments with it, but again, I think pipenv is better due to the aforementioned pipfiles.<br />
Mac automatically comes with Python 2 and 3 installed on it but I highly suggest not touching anything to do with those installations. Instead, if you install pyenv, you can control everything that has to do with python through it.  How to install this is located here: <a href="https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv">https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv</a>.</p>

<p>In short what this does is hijack your PATH variable through a ‚Äúshims‚Äù directory so that anytime your system does something Python-related, it is directed through the shims path where pyenv lives.</p>

<p>(Real quick: if you don‚Äôt know what a path variable is, open your terminal and type <code class="highlighter-rouge">bash echo "$PATH"</code>. This will print out the all the paths that your computer searches through separated by a ‚Äú:‚Äù. When you type ‚Äúpython‚Äù in the terminal, your computer goes through each of these paths to look for python and activates the first instance of it it sees. So when shims gets placed on the front of this path, it essentially will always be the first instance of python your computer sees. You can type <code class="highlighter-rouge">which python</code> in your terminal to see the default python your computer is using)</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="pipenv">pipenv</h3>
<p>You can install pipenv from here <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/">https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/</a>. This will be your new pip installer and will keep everything contained in a virtual environment dedicated to a project. All you have to do before starting a project is make sure you are in your project folder and type</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">pipenv shell</code></p>

<p>This will create a virtual environment specific to the folder you are in. You should see the name of your virtual environment appear above your prompt in the terminal. Then use</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">pipenv install package_name_here</code></p>

<p>to begin installing packages you need for your project. When you are finished with your project, you can write</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">pipenv lock</code></p>

<p>and this will save all the information about the packages used in a pipfile. This file can then be pushed to a repo with your project.  You can also output a requirements.txt file by writing</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">pipenv lock -r &gt; requirements.txt</code></p>

<p>To exit the virtual environment just type <code class="highlighter-rouge">exit</code>. To enter it again, go to the folder and type <code class="highlighter-rouge">pipenv shell</code>. You can then resume your work like you never left.</p>

<p>When you are all finished with a project and have already pipenv locked, you can write <code class="highlighter-rouge">exit</code> and then <code class="highlighter-rouge">pipenv --rm</code> to remove the virtual environment.</p>

<p>To install a virtual environment from a requirements.txt file write</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">pipenv install -r requirements.txt</code></p>

<p>Those are the basics. Some other commands I use somewhat frequently are <code class="highlighter-rouge">pipenv --venv</code> which will show you the path to your virtual environment and  <code class="highlighter-rouge">pipenv graph</code> to see every package that has been installed including all its dependencies.</p>

<h3 id="using-virtual-environments-with-jupyter-notebooks">Using Virtual Environments with Jupyter Notebooks</h3>
<p>When you start your project folder and create a virtual environment in it (<code class="highlighter-rouge">pipenv shell</code>), you can <code class="highlighter-rouge">pipenv install jupyter notebooks</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">pipenv install jupyterlab</code>. Once this is done write</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">python -m ipykernel install --user --name=environment_name</code></p>

<p>where enviroment_name is the name of your virtual environment (I don‚Äôt think it has to be but it‚Äôs good to know why you made the kernel). When you open up Jupyter, the option to use this kernel should be there. Click on it. Work your project, using pipenv to install packages you need, and then when all is finished, deactivate the kernel by writing</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">jupyter kernelspec uninstall environment_name</code></p>

<p>To see a list of all available kernels write</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">jupyter kernelspec list</code></p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="virtual-environments-with-anaconda">Virtual Environments with Anaconda</h3>
<p>To create a virual environment with Anaconda, navigate to the directory where your project is and write</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">conda create --name name_of_virtual_environment</code></p>

<p>To activate the virtual environment, write</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">source activate name_of_virtual_environment</code></p>

<p>If you‚Äôd like to control which version of Python you will use in this environment, write</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">source activate --name  name_of_virtual_environment python=X.X</code></p>

<p>where X.X is the version number of Python.</p>

<p>To deactivate your virtual environment, write</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">source deactivate</code></p>

<p>To view a list of all the virtual environments you currently have write</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">conda env list</code></p>

<p>To remove an environment write</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">conda remove --name name_of_virtual_environment --all</code></p>

<p>if instead you just want to remove some packages you can write them in lieu of the ‚Äìall option above.</p>

<p>Alternatively in the Anaconda Navigator, you can create and run virtual environments using the sidebar of the window.</p>

<h3 id="my-current-project-workflow">My Current Project Workflow</h3>
<p>Below is a quick synopsis of what I am essentially doing followed by code written in my .zshrc file that automates all of this.</p>

<p>Quick Synopsis:<br />
For the most part, I start a github repo from a desired template, clone it to my desktop, then use pyenv to choose which version of python I want to work with. Then I use pipenv to start my virtual environment via the process described above (write <code class="highlighter-rouge">pipenv shell</code> in the cloned directory in the terminal).</p>

<p>I then <code class="highlighter-rouge">pipenv jupyterlab</code> to install Jupyter Lab and create a kernel from my project by following the steps outlined in the previous section. I start my project in Jupyter Lab, use <code class="highlighter-rouge">!pipenv install package_name_here</code> to install packages as I need them in the notebook and work on my project.</p>

<p>When my project is finished, I exit out of the Jupyter Notebook, write <code class="highlighter-rouge">pipenv lock</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">pipenv lock -r &gt;requirements.txt</code> . Then I exit out of the virtual environment (by writing <code class="highlighter-rouge">exit</code>) and push everything up to github. Then I delete my virtual environment and remove the kernel I was using for it. And that‚Äôs it.</p>

<p>Automation:<br />
You can automate a lot of the above processes by writing functions in your .zshrc file (cd to your home directory and open your .zshrc file). My functions are shown below.</p>

<p><img src="../../../../assets/imgs/blogs/2019-12-18/zshrc2.png" alt="" /><br />
<img src="../../../../assets/imgs/blogs/2019-12-18/zshrc3.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><br />
In order to use the start_project() function listed above, you need to <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line">go to github and get a repo token</a>. This repo token can then be stored as an <a href="https://youtu.be/5iWhQWVXosU">environment variable</a>.  To use this function, type</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">start_project project_name</code></p>

<p>in the command line where <code class="highlighter-rouge">project_name</code> is the name of your project. This function will automatically create a repo with a template in github and on your desktop (I hardcoded this template and it‚Äôs easy to change).  Then to start a virtual environment you can use the pipenv shell command once inside the directory. Or you can use the function below called <code class="highlighter-rouge">make_env</code> to do this and add autopep8, flake8, and set up the requirements.txt</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><img src="../../../../assets/imgs/blogs/2019-12-18/make-env.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>After the project is finished, you can use the end_project() function below to remove all kernels, remove the virtual environment, and push to github.  Note to use this function, you must write the project name after end_project, like so</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">end_project project_name</code></p>

<p>where again, <code class="highlighter-rouge">project_name</code> is the name of your project.</p>

<p><img src="../../../../assets/imgs/blogs/2019-12-18/end-proj.png" alt="" /></p>
