<p>What is web-scraping? Itâ€™s taking data from web pages and storing them elsewhere. Via webscraping, you can select data from web pages and store that data into a csv, database, etc.</p>

<p>There is a bit of legal ambiguity around the scraping of websites to be aware of.

Here are a list of articles regarding the legality of it for those who are interested.</p>
